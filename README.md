# PumpSteer

PumpSteer is a custom Home Assistant integration that dynamically optimizes your heat pump by manipulating the outdoor temperature sensor input. It helps save energy and money by adjusting your heating strategy based on electricity prices, indoor temperature, weather forecasts, and thermal inertia.

**This control system regulates heat supply solely based on outdoor temperature and lacks direct integration with your existing heating system. Therefore, it requires that the basic settings in your heating system already function correctly to achieve a consistent and comfortable indoor climate.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer 

I'm not an expert in programming, energy systems, or automation. This setup is based on personal experiments and use. I cannot guarantee it will work for everyone, and I take no responsibility for any issues or damage resulting from the use of this configuration or code.

**Use at your own risk and thoroughly test it in your environment.**

## üóÉÔ∏è Recorder Data Requirement

PumpSteer calculates price levels using 72 hours of raw electricity price history from Home Assistant's recorder. Long-term statistics are not used, so ensure the recorder keeps at least three days of state data for your price sensor. Without sufficient history the price category may remain "normal" and the integration can appear stuck.

> üí° **Note:** Holiday mode is only active when the outdoor temperature is below the summer threshold.

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Precool Mode

When the hourly temperature forecast shows that any of the next 24 hours will exceed the summer threshold, PumpSteer enters *precool* mode. It sends the braking temperature (25 ¬∞C by default) to the heat pump so heating stops before the warm period arrives. This prevents unnecessary heating just before summer-like conditions.

## üîß Installation via HACS (Custom Repository)

If PumpSteer is not yet available in HACS:

1. Go to **HACS > ‚ãÆ > Custom Repositories**
2. Add: `https://github.com/JohanAlvedal/PumpSteer`
3. Choose **Integration** as category
4. Install PumpSteer
5. Restart Home Assistant
6. Follow the setup guide and select helper entities

**For a complete step-by-step installation guide, including setting up helper entities and automations, please refer to our wiki:**

[**PumpSteer - Installation och Grundkonfiguration**](https://github.com/JohanAlvedal/PumpSteer/wiki/PumpSteer-%E2%80%90-Installation-och-Grundkonfiguration)

---

## üå§Ô∏è Weather Forecast Automation

PumpSteer requires hourly temperature forecasts in `input_text.hourly_forecast_temperatures`. Instead of manual entry, use our automated blueprint:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.githubusercontent.com%2FJohanAlvedal%2F48fb8b3e1ef5fc3a70b5c473be54e2fe%2Fraw%2Fpumpsteer_temperature_forcast.yaml)

### What it does:
- üîÑ Automatically fetches 24-hour temperature forecasts
- üìä Formats data as comma-separated values for PumpSteer
- ‚è∞ Updates on configurable intervals (default: every 30 min)
- üå°Ô∏è Works with SMHI, Met.no, OpenWeatherMap, and more

### Quick Setup:
1. **Import blueprint** from the Gist above
2. **Create automation** using your weather entity  
3. **Set target** to `input_text.hourly_forecast_temperatures`
4. **Configure update interval** (recommended: every 30 minutes)

Once configured, PumpSteer will automatically receive fresh weather data for optimal heating decisions without any manual intervention.

## üß† How it works

PumpSteer controls your heat pump's perceived demand using a fake outdoor temperature:

* Slightly increases heating (1 ¬∞C overshoot) only when electricity prices are very cheap
* Avoids heating when prices are high
* Goes to neutral mode when stable
* Disables heating when it's warm outside (summer mode)
* Pre-cools ahead of warm periods when the forecast exceeds the summer threshold
* Lowers target temp to 16 ¬∞C during holidays
* Learns over time how your house reacts and adjusts settings (if `autotune_inertia` is enabled)

All control is done locally without any cloud dependency.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Logging

* Errors and warnings are logged in Home Assistant
* Sensor shows `unavailable` when data is missing
* ML data is stored in `pumpsteer_ml_data.json` (max 100 sessions)
* Auto-tuned `inertia` is saved in `adaptive_state.json`
